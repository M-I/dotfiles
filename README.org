* Introduction
This repository contains my dotfiles, which are designed to work quickly and efficiently with vim-like keybindings.
Too archive this i use the following [[Software][Software]]. You will also find my [[NixOS][NixOS]]
onfiguration. 

[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix package manager]], it is
completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other
advantages.

I strongly recommend that you take a look at it.

*Every key must be pressed in combination with the super/win key*.  
For a deeper insight, check out the config files.  
Note: You can press super/win key and move a window around in floating mode.  

* NixOS
In the folder [[./nixos/][nixos]], you will find a configuration.nix, package.nix and some system_*.nix
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
mkdir /home/user/
git clone https://github.com/oyren/dotfiles.git /home/user/
mv /etc/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos/configuration.nix.bak
ln -s /home/user/dotfiles/nixos/configuration.nix /etc/nixos
ln -s /home/user/dotfiles/nixos/package.nix /etc/nixos
ln -s /home/user/dotfiles/nixos/system_t470.nix /etc/nixos/system.nix

#+END_SRC
*Note:*

*I have multiple system.nix, pick one for your needs. (e.g. system_tower.nix for
your tower pc)*

*My username is 'user', if you want to use another, you have to change it
manually (see the Paths and configuration.nix).*




* emacs
Can't post my emacs config here becouse it is messy. Here are some Notes:
