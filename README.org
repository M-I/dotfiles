* Introduction
This repository contains my dotfiles, which are designed to work quickly and efficiently with vim-like keybindings.
Too archive this i use the following [[#software][Software]]. You will also find my
[[#nixos][NixOS]] configuration. 

[[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix package manager]], it is
completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable, and has many other
advantages.

I strongly recommend that you take a look at it.

| *Key*           | *Description*                               |

| enter           | spawn roxterm                                |
| {1-9,0}         | switch to workspace N                        |
| shift + {1-9,0} | move current window to workspace N           |
| {h,j,k,l}       | vim keybindings to change current focus      |
| shift+{h,j,k,l} | vim keybindings to move the current window   |
| alt+{h,j,k,l}   | resize current window                        |
| ctrl+{h,j,k,l}  | preselect position of new window             |

| y               | lockscreen (i3lock)                          |

*Every key must be pressed in combination with the super/win key*.  
For a deeper insight, check out the config files.  
Note: You can press super/win key and move a window around in floating mode.  

* NixOS
In the folder [[./nixos/][nixos]], you will find a configuration.nix, package.nix, desktop.nix and some system_*.nix/package_*.nix
#+BEGIN_SRC sh

*Note:*

*I have multiple system.nix/package.nix, choose one of them and adapt it to your needs. (e.g. system_tower.nix for
your tower pc)*

*My username is 'user', if you want to use another, you have to change it
manually (see the Paths and nix files).*

*desktop.nix is used to set fonts and themes.*



* emacs
Can't post my emacs config here becouse it is messy. Here are some Notes:


I use a [[http://spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] in vim mode.
My Mailsetup is a combination of notmuch, mbsync and msmtp.

My Org-mode setup is very similar to [[http://doc.norang.ca/org-mode.html][Guide by Bernt Hansen]] and [[http://cachestocaches.com/2016/9/my-workflow-org-agenda/][My Workflow with
Org-Agenda]].

I also write my studies transcripts in org-mode and export them whit
[[http://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/][Read The Docs]] (Setup and Demo can be found under [[https://github.com/fniessen/org-html-themes][Org-HTML-Themes]]).
